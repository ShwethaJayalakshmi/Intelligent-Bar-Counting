Intelligent Bar Counting
In Some of the steel rod inventory staff is maually counting the number of 8mm,16mm,12mm,etc.,This is both time consuming and error prone.The main objective of this project ia to minimize the time taken in counting the steel rods with the constraints to minimize maual effort.
To solve these problems, using machine vision and computer image processing technology,we design a real-time steel bars system with a detailed image processing algorithm.
